# SourceGraph Libre

This is a fork of SourceGraph with a few modifications:

 - It only contains the opensource code. The proprietary code is removed.
   - *Please note that the git history is preserved, so if you browse back in time you will see the proprietary code and you must respect its license.*
 - It may contain some modifications to improve the behaviour of the opensource version.
 - Hopefully, a docker container will be provider to make it easier to install.
